            <h2>Reviews</h2>
            <p><strong>Vgames (90/100):</strong> "Persona 3 is one of my all time favorites and all I wanted was a full remake for it, I got it with the beautiful P5 style as well, re recorded soundtrack and revamped character designs, this remake is a love letter to all the fans of the series."</p>
            <p><strong>Dexerto (100/100):</strong> "If the goal of Persona 3 Reload is to modernize a classic JRPG from the PlayStation 2 era for a new generation of players, then it is undeniably a success. While there may be some legitimate disappointment over the lack of content from Persona 3 FES and Portable, what is here is more than enough to cement Reload’s status as a solid remake that delivers the now definitive version of Persona 3."</p>
            <p><strong>GAMINGbible (90/100):</strong> "Whether you’re a lifelong Persona fan or a total newcomer, Persona 3: Reload is well worth your time as both a stunning remake and a unique masterpiece."</p>
